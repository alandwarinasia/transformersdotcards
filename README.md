## Transformers.cards ##

Transformers.cards is an unofficial progressive "web app" for displaying card and product information from Hasbro's [Transformers TCG](https://transformers.hasbro.com/en-us/tradingcardgame) that is maintained by community members as a free service for other fans.

It is 'built' with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The product/card data is currently stored in an [Airtable](https://airtable.com) database, which can be queried via an API, to facilitate integration with third-party applications.
