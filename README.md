## Transformers.cards ##

Transformers.cards was an unofficial progressive "web app" for displaying card and product information from Hasbro's [Transformers TCG](https://transformers.hasbro.com/en-us/tradingcardgame) that was maintained by community members as a free service for other fans.

It was 'built' with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The product/card data was cstored in an [Airtable](https://airtable.com) database, which can be queried via an API, to facilitate integration with third-party applications.

### API

Though the site is now gone, API access continues to be available until January 1, 2021. Documentation for the [Transformers.cards](https://transformers.cards) API can be found here: https://transformers.cards/api
